# Browser Parking Lot

The objective of this project is to store useful links with a todo item that can be prioritized using the labels HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

An item contains:

- a link
- a short text description
- date of creation
- priority label (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)

The Browser Parking Lot enables you to eliminate tabs in your browser. Therefore, we reduce memory consumption of your computer, because using the browser as a todo list is counterproductive.
